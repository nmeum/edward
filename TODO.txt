* Improve compilation speed
* Add more tests for addresses ranges with semicolon character
* Don't cause exception when file doesn't exist (e command etc)
* align handling of end-of-file character with POSIX
	* Scheme's read-char procedure does not allow
	  reading past EOF but ed requires this
* make sure zero address is handled correctly everywhere
* distinguish between editor-error and internal error
	* re-raise the later in the exception handler
* undo command
* also support for various regex-based commands:
	* global command
	* interactive global command
	* global non-matched command
	* interactive global non-matched command
* implement asynchronous event section from POSIX.1-2008
* using a vector instead of a list for the text-editor buffer may be
