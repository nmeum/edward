* make sure zero address is handled correctly everywhere
* consider switching to a CHICKEN inline documentation tool
	* https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/scm2wiki
	* â€¦
* list command
* undo command
* improve error messages. For example, parser error should state the
  input line where the error occurred (useful if input is a file)
	* implement "consequences of errors" section correctly
* add support for regular expression addresses
	* requires implementing POSIX BRE in Scheme or rely on CHICKEN's
	  foreign function interface to use the POSIX C implementation
* implement support of using write with shell command line (! file prefix)
