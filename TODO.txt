* scheme macro for expanding addresses specified in the ed standard to
  the correct scheme list data type
* allowing passing single address to commands which expect range (e.g.
  delete)
* implement commands which require conformation (q, e, …)
	* return editor state in each command handler?
	* extract command char in parser and store that in editor state?
* make sure zero address is handled correctly everywhere
* consider switching to a CHICKEN inline documentation tool
	* https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/scm2wiki
	* …
* improve error messages. For example, parser error should state the
  input line where the error occurred (useful if input is a file)
* add support for regular expression addresses
	* requires implementing POSIX BRE in Scheme or rely on CHICKEN's
	  foreign function interface to use the POSIX C implementation
