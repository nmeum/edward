* Refactor define-command and parse-print-cmd
* Fix use of substitute command with global command
	* Global command executes substitute command
	  for each selected line
	* If the selected line doesn't match the substitute
	  command an error is raised (as per POSIX)
	* How is this supposed to be handled?
* "Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses;"
	* Example: 1,2,3,4,5p
	* Example: 3;/foo/;+2p
* Improve compilation speed
* Add more tests for addresses ranges with semicolon character
* align handling of end-of-file character with POSIX
	* Scheme's read-char procedure does not allow
	  reading past EOF but ed requires this
* Figure out if the library/program distinction is actually useful
	* Maybe possible to extend edward with custom commands etc.
	  through the library but currently not supported
* integration tests:
	* compare exit status
	* consider running GNU ed in traditional mode (-G)
* make sure zero address is handled correctly everywhere
* undo command
* implement asynchronous event section from POSIX.1-2008
* using a vector instead of a list for the text-editor buffer may be
  more efficient
