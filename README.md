## Status

The goal of this project is creating an implementation of the
[`ed(1)`][ed posix] text editor, as defined in POSIX.1-2008, in R7RS
[CHICKEN Scheme][chicken]. All commands mandated by POSIX have been
implemented. However, this software is still in early stages of
development, expect bugs.

Known bugs and future ideas are documented in the `TODO.md` file.

## Design

This implementation relies on [parser combinators][parser combinators]
as well as hygienic Scheme macros to ease the implementation of ed
commands. Each ed command is defined using a macro (i.e. similar to how
one would normally define procedures in Scheme) and parsed through
provided parser combinators. Thereby making this ed implementation very
hackable and easy to extend. Presently, the implementation is also split
into a CHICKEN program and library component which may allow defining
custom commands through user-defined configuration files in the future.

## Installation

If a correctly configured CHICKEN toolchain is available run:

	$ chicken-install

This will compile `edward` and add the binary to your `$PATH`. If
creation of a statically linked and optimized binary is desired, pass
`-feature release`. This can be combined with the flags described below
to package this software for a distribution.

### Building without installing

For development setups, one can build `edward` as follows:

	$ export CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH="${CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}:$(pwd)"
	$ chicken-install -n

This will create an executable binary in `./bin/edward`.

## Tests

This repository contains both unit tests and integration tests. The
latter require a reference implementation of a POSIX.1-2008 compatible
ed implementation. Currently, [GNU ed][gnu ed] is used for this purpose.

Both unit and integration tests can be run using:

	$ ./run-tests.sh

## Usage

For interactive usage I can highly recommend using this software in
conjunction with a [readline][GNU readline] frontend such as
[rlwrap][rlwrap github]. This enables readline-like keybindings (e.g.
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+W, â€¦) as well as input history support.

Detailed usage instructions for the `ed(1)` text editor can be found in
the [POSIX documentation][ed posix]. Additionally, a nice introduction
to the editor is provided in the book *The Unix Programming Environment*
by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike (Appendix 1: Editor Summary).

## Portability

The code was originally intended to be written in purely standard
confirming [R7RS Scheme][r7rs small]. However, as it turned out that
implementing `ed(1)` properly requires access to some POSIX functions
(which are not standardized in R7RS or any [SRFI][srfi]) this approach
was eventually abandoned.

Presently, the following CHICKEN Scheme specific stuff is used:

* The CHICKEN [matchable][chicken matchable] egg for pattern matching
  ([SRFI 204][srfi 204] is supposed to standardize pattern matching
  but is still in draft status).
* The CHICKEN Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for accessing POSIX
  functions required by `ed(1)` (e.g. `popen(3)`, `isatty(3)` and
  `regexec(3)`).
* It is assumed that `eq?` performs pointer comparison for strings
  (undefined behaviour in R7RS but implemented in CHICKEN).
