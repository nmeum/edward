## About

This is a POSIX-compatible implementation of the standard Unix text
editor [`ed(1)`][ed posix]. The implementation is written entirely in
[R7RS][r7rs] [CHICKEN Scheme][chicken] and provides a Scheme library
interface for extending the editor with custom commands.

## Status

I am presently not aware of any POSIX.1-2008 conformance issues. The
library interface, for extending `edward` with custom commands, is
usable but still very experimental and subject to change. Refer to
the `TODO.md` file for more information.

## Design

This implementation relies on [parser combinators][parser combinators]
as well as [hygienic Scheme macros][hygienic macros] to ease the
implementation of ed commands. Each ed command is defined using a macro
(i.e. similar to how one would normally define procedures in Scheme) and
parsed through provided parser combinators. In a sense, thus employing
[language-oriented programming][language-oriented programming] to
implement ed commands and thereby making this ed implementation very
hackable and easy to extend. The implementation is also split into a
CHICKEN program and various library components which allows defining
custom commands (refer to the library interface documentation below).

## Installation

If a correctly configured CHICKEN 5.3 toolchain is available run:

	$ chicken-install

This will compile `edward` and add the binary to your `$PATH`.

### Building without installing

For development setups, one can build `edward` as follows:

	$ export CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH="$(pwd):${CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}"
	$ chicken-install -n

This will create an executable binary in `./bin/edward`.

## Tests

This repository contains both unit tests and integration tests. The
latter require a reference implementation of a POSIX.1-2008 compatible
ed implementation. Currently, [GNU ed >= 1.18][gnu ed] is used for this
purpose.

Both unit and integration tests can be run using:

	$ ./run-tests.sh

## Usage

For interactive usage I can highly recommend using this software in
conjunction with a [readline][GNU readline] frontend such as
[rlwrap][rlwrap github]. This enables readline-like keybindings (e.g.
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+W, â€¦) as well as input history support.

Detailed usage instructions for the `ed(1)` text editor can be found in
the [POSIX documentation][ed posix]. Additionally, a nice introduction
to the editor is provided in the book *The Unix Programming Environment*
by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike (Appendix 1: Editor Summary). In
general, since ed is an old editor which hasn't changed much in the past
centuries, many historic documents explaining its usage are still
applicable today. Most notably, volume 2A of the seventh edition of the
[UNIX Programmer's Manual][unix v7vol2a] contains two documents which
provide a beginner-friendly introduction to the editor: *A Tutorial
Introduction to the UNIX Text Editor* and *Advanced Editing on UNIX*
both written by Brian W. Kernighan.

## Library Interface

Apart from an `ed(1)` implementation, `edward` also provides a library
interface for extending the editor with custom commands. While the
implementation provided here focuses solely on POSIX compatibility,
extension to the POSIX standard can be supplied separately. The library
interface is still in early stages of development, not well documented,
and subject to change.

The `edward` library can be used by creating a custom CHICKEN Scheme
program which imports the required CHICKEN libraries, defines custom
commands through provided hygienic macros, and executes `(edward-main)`
to start the editor. For example, an `edward` variant which also
provides the `z` command (included with many BSD implementations of
`ed(1)`) could be implemented as follows:

	(import (scheme base)
	        (chicken port)
	
	        (edward cli)
	        (edward parse)
	        (edward ed cmd)
	        (edward ed addr)
	        (edward ed editor))
	
	;; Executor for the 'z' command.
	(define (exec-scroll editor amount)
	  (let* ((start  (addr->line editor (make-addr '(current-line))))
	         (end    (addr->line editor (make-addr
	                                      (cons 'nth-line
	                                            (min
	                                              (editor-lines editor)
	                                              (+ start amount)))))))
	    (exec-print editor (cons start end))))
	
	;; Parser for the 'z' command.
	(define-edit-cmd (scroll exec-scroll)
	  (parse-cmd-char #\z)
	  (parse-default
	    parse-digits
	    (let*-values (((port) (current-output-port))
	                  ((rows _) (if (terminal-port? port)
	                              (terminal-size port)
	                              (values 22 72))))
	      rows)))
	
	;; Start the editor
	(edward-main)

Save this code in `edward++.scm` and compile it as follows:

	$ csc -R r7rs edward++.scm

Afterwards, drop the resulting `edward++` binary somewhere in your
`$PATH` and invoke it as you normally would invoke `edward` and enjoy
scrolling through text with the new `z` command. Of cause, it is
entirely possible to define multiple commands in this way. Refer to
`lib/ed/cmd.scm` to see how the commands mandated by POSIX are
implemented using this interface.

## History

The existing GNU and BSD ed implementations are both derived from an
implementation written by Andrew Moore in the early-to-mid 1990s. As
such, they still share a lot of code and are potentially subject to the
same bugs [\[1\]][ed history]. To the best of my knowledge, edward is
the first (largely) POSIX compatible ed implementation which is not
derived from Andrew's original implementation.
