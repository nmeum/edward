## Status

The goal of this project is creating an implementation of the
[`ed(1)`][ed posix] text editor, as defined in POSIX.1-2008, in R7RS
[CHICKEN Scheme][chicken]. The majority of ed commands have been
implemented. The following commands are still missing:

* Undo Command
* Global Command
* Interactive Global Command
* Global Non-Matched Command
* Interactive Global Non-Matched Command

The following mandated behaviour has not been implemented yet:

* Asynchronous Events (i.e. signal handling)
* Use of substitute command with delimiters other than `/`
* â€¦

## Installation

If a correctly configured CHICKEN toolchain is available run:

	$ chicken-install

This will compile `edward` and add the binary to your `$PATH`.

### Building without installing

For development setups, one can build `edward` as follows:

	$ export CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH="${CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}:$(pwd)"
	$ chicken-install -n

This will create an executable binary in `./bin/edward`.

## Tests

This repository contains both unit tests and integration tests. The
latter require a reference implementation of a POSIX.1-2008 compatible
ed implementation. For instance, [GNU ed][gnu ed]. The reference
implementation is determined using the `REF_IMPL` environment variable.

Both unit and integration tests can be run using:

	$ ./run-tests.sh

## Portability

The code is mostly written in standard [R7RS Scheme][r7rs small].
However, it presently uses [CHICKEN Scheme][chicken] specific code for
pattern matching. This code will be replaced by [SRFI 204][srfi 204] in
the near future. Furthermore, the code base relies heavily on a FFI for
`popen(3)`, `isatty(3)` and `regexec(3)`. Since there is no finalized
SRFI standardising a Scheme FFI, this code is presently
implementation-specific and currently only implemented for CHICKEN.
