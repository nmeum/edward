## Status

The goal of this project is creating an implementation of the
[`ed(1)`][ed posix] text editor, as defined in POSIX.1-2008, in R7RS
[CHICKEN Scheme][chicken]. For non-interactive usage, I am currently
not aware of any POSIX conformance issues.

Known bugs and future ideas are documented in the `TODO.md` file.

## Design

This implementation relies on [parser combinators][parser combinators]
as well as [hygienic Scheme macros][hygienic macros] to ease the
implementation of ed commands. Each ed command is defined using a macro
(i.e. similar to how one would normally define procedures in Scheme) and
parsed through provided parser combinators. In a sense, thus employing
[language-oriented programming][language-oriented programming] to
implement ed commands and thereby making this ed implementation very
hackable and easy to extend. Presently, the implementation is also split
into a CHICKEN program and library component which may allow defining
custom commands through user-defined configuration files in the future.

## Installation

If a correctly configured CHICKEN 5.3 toolchain is available run:

	$ chicken-install

This will compile `edward` and add the binary to your `$PATH`.

### Building without installing

For development setups, one can build `edward` as follows:

	$ export CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH="${CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}:$(pwd)"
	$ chicken-install -n

This will create an executable binary in `./bin/edward`.

## Tests

This repository contains both unit tests and integration tests. The
latter require a reference implementation of a POSIX.1-2008 compatible
ed implementation. Currently, [GNU ed >= 1.18][gnu ed] is used for this
purpose.

Both unit and integration tests can be run using:

	$ ./run-tests.sh

## Usage

For interactive usage I can highly recommend using this software in
conjunction with a [readline][GNU readline] frontend such as
[rlwrap][rlwrap github]. This enables readline-like keybindings (e.g.
Ctrl+A, Ctrl+W, â€¦) as well as input history support.

Detailed usage instructions for the `ed(1)` text editor can be found in
the [POSIX documentation][ed posix]. Additionally, a nice introduction
to the editor is provided in the book *The Unix Programming Environment*
by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike (Appendix 1: Editor Summary). In
general, since ed is an old editor which hasn't changed much in the past
centuries, many historic documents explaining its usage are still
applicable today. Most notably, volume 2A of the seventh edition of the
[UNIX Programmer's Manual][unix v7vol2a] contains two documents which
provide a beginner-friendly introduction to the editor: *A Tutorial
Introduction to the UNIX Text Editor* and *Advanced Editing on UNIX*
both written by Brian W. Kernighan.

## Portability

The code was originally intended to be written in purely standard
confirming [R7RS Scheme][r7rs small]. However, it turned out that
implementing `ed(1)` properly requires access to several POSIX functions
which are not standardized in R7RS or any [SRFI][srfi]. Initially, it
was attempted to overcome this limitation via a custom Foreign Function
Interface (FFI). Unfortunately, there is also no SRFI standardizing a
Scheme FFI and as such it was difficult to support multiple
implementations with the FFI. For this reason, this approach was
eventually abandoned and the code now uses several CHICKEN extensions
directly.
